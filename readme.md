With the evolution of deep learning in the past
decade, more biomedical related problems that seemed strenuous,
are now feasible. The introduction of U-net and Mask RCNN architectures has paved a way for many object detection
and segmentation tasks in numerous applications ranging from
security to biomedical applications. In the cell biology domain,
light microscopy imaging provides a cheap and accessible source
of raw data to study biological phenomena. By leveraging such
data and deep learning techniques, human diseases can be easily
diagnosed and the process of treatment development can be
greatly expedited. In microscopic imaging, accurate segmentation
of individual cells is a crucial step to allow better insight into
cellular heterogeneity. To address the aforementioned challenges,
DeepCeNS is proposed in this paper to detect and segment cells
and nucleus in microscopic images. We have used EVICAN2
dataset which contains microscopic images from a variety of
microscopes having numerous cell cultures, to evaluate the
proposed pipeline. DeepCeNS outperforms EVICAN-MRCNN by
a significant margin on the EVICAN2 dataset.
